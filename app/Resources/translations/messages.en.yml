      title: Wamcar, Why?
      content: >
        <p>Wamcar is the result of numerous digital experiments in the automotive distribution sector. We make the following observation:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Many video influencers are solicited by brands for content
           promotion and sponsorship. If this is a source of revenue, it also generates
           constraints on production itself and may possibly reduce the quality of the video.
           Moreover, these influencers do not want to directly manage the sale or after-sales of the products
           forward. </li>
          <li>On the other hand, sellers don’t always have the bricks to create good videos,
           engaging women who can enable them to increase their community in the digital world.
           They need tools to create quality videos in accordance with the graphic charter of the
           brand they represent, and need help getting started. </li>
          <li>So we create winning teams between sellers and influencers, while giving them the
           tools to collaborate in the best way. </li>
        </ul>
